# Browser-Based Minesweeper

## Feature Roadmap

- Mine flagging (i.e. a way for users to indicate where they think the mines are)

- Timer (i.e. set option to count time to solve or countdown to zero)

- Animations (e.g. when uncovering empty regions)

- Users can set difficulty (e.g. board size and mine count)

- Different numbered cells represented by a different color (e.g. 1s are red, 2s are purple, etc. see example picture)

- Animation when user wins or loses and reveal all mines

- Unit tests covering edge cases.
